  <h1>File management using the command line</h1>
  
  <p>You can browse and manage files using the command line just as in the graphical enviroment. 
     Let's compare managing files using a graphical and a text user interface.  </p>
     <p>Open the graphical file browser. In ubuntu, open the apllication called "Files", 
         or write the command nautilus and press <code>ENTER</code>. <code>nautilus</code> won't work in windows. In MacOS,
          open finder and press the key <code>Shift + Cmd + H</code>.</p>
          <p>You should now be in your home folder. The home folder holds all the personal files
               and folders of user. If you are using one of the department's computers, the 
               contents of your home folders are the same regardless of physical computer you are using.
            This is because the contents fetched from elsewhere. If you are using your personal computer,
             the home folder only includes the files on that physical computer. </p>
             <p>Note that if you opened the graphical file browser using the command line, the shell 
                 is "locked", and you can't run any other commands using that window. You can close the 
                 current running program by pressing <code>CTRL + C</code>. You can press the keys repeatedly if necessary. </p>
                 <p>Because the combination <code>CTRL + C</code> has a special meaning on the command line, in Linux you 
                     will have to use <code>CTRL + SHIFT + C</code> to copy selected text and <code>CTRL + SHIFT + V</code> to paste.
                 </p>
                 <p>Your home folder probably a bunch of miscellanous files and folder, like Downloads and 
                     Documents. Open the command line in order to seee the same folders on the 
                     text-based interface. You can do this by writing is on the command line and
                     pressing <code> ENTER</code>. The output should something like this:
                    
                 </p>
